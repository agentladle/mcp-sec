### 2. Client Configuration

Since AgentLadle is a cloud-hosted service, you **do not** need to install or run any local servers. We use a **stateless HTTP** implementation.

Add the following configuration to your MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentladle-mcp": {
      "type": "streamableHttp",
      "url": "https://mcp.agentladle.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

*Don't forget to replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with the actual key you generated in step 1.*

## 🛠️ Usage Example

Once configured, simply open Claude Desktop and try asking:
- **Notes Deep Dive & Attribution**: *"Analyze BYD's 2025 accounts receivable breakdown."* or *"Find the direction of CATL's capital expenditures in 2025."*
- **Benchmarking & Restructuring**: *"Extract Gree's 2025 balance sheet and restructure it into a managerial balance sheet."*
